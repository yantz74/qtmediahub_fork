Confluence.qml is the "screen". It has a background, root menu and the 
headers/footers. It has 3 states: showingRootBlade, showingHeaders
and showingNothing. A mousegrabber element in Confluence serves to
provide as a container for modal dialog.

A Window is a basic windowing component. Each Window has a blade with
z = 1. It occupies the the full screen. Pressing escape closes the window.
Windows can be nested. Child windows would usually want to set their z to
be one more than the blade's z. All top level windows are children of the
screen (Confluence.qml).

Windows can display other Windows that are not it's children (for example, 
the AVPlayer is used by MusicWindow and VideoWindow).

Every Window when opened, adds itself to the Window stack.

A Dialog displays a modal dialog.

Focus handling:
                            Screen
                    W1        W2        W3
                W4         Dialog

Screen, Dialog, Windows are FocusScopes. On startup, Screen gets active Focus
and this is passed around by setting focus=true.

When a Window is shown, it sets focus on itself. When the Window closes, it turn
on the focus of the topmost item in the Window stack.
