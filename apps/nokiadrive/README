Abstract
========
This application is supposed to be used in the rapid skin.
It is an integration of the NokiaDrive application into the skin.

MapsPlugin
=============
NokiaDrive requires libMapsPlugin.so. The library can either be installed in
imports/MapsPlugin or in in qt-path/imports/MapsPlugin along with an
adequate qmldir file: "plugin MapsPlugin"
The library can be retreived from http://bf-hudson-00.europe.nokia.com:8080/

NokiaDrive
==========
The NokiaDrive application source code needs to be checked out from a
different repository, e.g.:
https://svni1.isource-nokia.nokia.com/isource/svnroot/mamba-ui/branches/PR1.2_trunk

The "nokiadrive.patch" has to be applied (at least until the changes have been
committed to the official NokiaDrive repository).

To build the NokiaDrive plugin enter the following commands:
$ qmake CONFIG+=plugin
$ make

Integration
===========
To use the application in the rapid skin run the "setup.sh" script:
$ ./setup.sh path/to/nokiadrive
It will create links to the NokiaDrive application, create qmldir files
and copy additioanl files that are needed.
